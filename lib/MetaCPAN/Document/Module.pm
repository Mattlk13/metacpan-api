=head1 SYNOPSIS

    MetaCPAN::Document::Module->new(
        {
            name    => "Some::Module",
            version => "1.1.1"
        }
    );


=head1 PROPERTIES

=head2 name

B<Required>

=head2 name.analyzed

=head2 name.camelcase

Name of the module. When searching for a module it is advised to use use both
the C<analyzed> and the C<camelcase> property.

=head2 version

Contains the raw version string.

=head2 indexed

B<Default 0>

Indicates whether the module should be included in the search index or
not. Releases usually exclude modules in folders like C<t/> or C<example/>
from the index.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 hide_from_pause( $content, $file_name )

Using this pragma, you can hide a module from the CPAN indexer:

 package # hide me
   Foo;

This methods searches C<$content> for the package declaration. If it's
not declared in one line, the module is considered not-indexed.

=head2 set_associated_pod

Expects an instance C<$file> of L<MetaCPAN::Document::File> as first parameter
and a HashRef C<$pod> which contains all files with a L<MetaCPAN::Document::File/documentation>
and maps those to the file names.

L</associated_pod> is set to the path of the file, which contains the documentation.
